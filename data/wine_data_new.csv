Named in homage to Marguerite de Massaut, a 16th-century owner of the estate, the wine is aged in new wood that gives it a minty character.

US,"Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance.

It's a polished and complex wine that brings to mind a perfect steak.",Cuvée Alis,48,California,Eola-Amity Hills,Gamay Noir,Amapola Creek

It still needs aging, so don't drink before 2016.",Casa de Santar Reserva,22,California,Mendocino County,Sauvignon Blanc,Dão Sul

Italy,"Pretty aromas suggest plum, red berry, leather, graphite and eucalyptus.

US,"As is often the case with Oregon's 2011 Pinots, this remains stubbornly tight, and shows herbal and stem flavors rather than pretty fruit.

Underpinnings of acid and tannin, plus the still sharp-edged pomegranate fruit, may carry it up to 2024.",Heritage,40,California,North Coast,Chardonnay,Kramer

France,"This impressive wood-aged wine has weight, rich black and red berry flavors and a smooth, unctuous texture. With its concentration, ripeness, acidity and tannins, it could age through 2016.",La Réserve du Château,30,California,Côtes du Lot,Malbec,Château de Pierreux
US,"Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in. After that initial assault, the palate begins to get more interesting complexities of black currants, blueberries, minerals and oak. The suggestion is ageability, but only limited. Give it until 2016–2017 years and drink with hearty fare.",,95,Catalonia,Calaveras County,Sangiovese,Coup de Foudre
Portugal,"Dense and structured, this is a firm wine from the Santar estate. It is powered by its tannins and partnered with ripe black plum fruits. There is a feeling of tough rocks, a dry core that need some time. Drink from 2015.",Casa de Santar,,Catalonia,Ribera del Duero,Tinto del Pais,Dão Sul

US,"A small planting of an unusual “Upright” clone yields this fragrant, smoky, lightly earthy Pinot Noir. Chock full of briary red fruits, it's a tart, lip-smacking wine, drinking well in its youth, but also positioned (via bracing acidity) for further years of bottle age. The young fruit gives a pretty, cherry candy note to the finish.",The Morgster,30,Turkey,Santa Clara Valley,Pinot Noir,Angel Vine
US,"This is a tannic, acidic, hard-to-appreciate wine due to the cold conditions of the 2011 vintage. But the wine, which is 100% Cabernet and was aged in 50% new French oak, still is a great success, testimony to skillful viticultural and winemaking practices. With a solid core of black currants, it wants until 2020 in the cellar.",Maxine's Vineyard,55,Washington,Napa Valley,Sangiovese,Bardessono

Chile,"Despite showing raspy rawness on the nose, this Cab Franc is also aromatic with earth, spice, leather and leafy black fruits. The palate is tannic and slightly reduced, while flavors of baked berry, licorice, hard spices and chocolate finish herbal, peppery and gritty in feel due to residual tannic grab. Drink through 2017.",Edición Limitada,25,California,Lodi,Vermentino,Morandé

Spain,"Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur.

Medium in weight, it eases into a mellow finish.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,46,Maipo Valley,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Sauvignon Blanc,Bruliam

Spain,"Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab.

US,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020.",Will Jarvis' Science Project,135,California,Columbia Gorge (OR),Pinot Gris,Jarvis
France,"Pure Négrette produces a smooth, black cherry and red berry-flavored wine. Light hints of wood from aging in big barrels have helped to give the wine a rich and spicy character.

Italy,"Made from the native grape Pugnitello, this hearty red opens with aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs, scorched earth, allspice and overripe black fruit. The warm, forward palate doles out baked plum, ripe blackberries, blue flowers, clove and the heat of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins wrap around the palate, but the dominant alcohol throws it off balance and gives it a monolithic character.",,50,Provence,Vin de Savoie,Rosé,San Felice

Light and clean flavors suggest watermelon and raspberry with a hint of cherry.",Wirtz Vineyard Reserve,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Chardonnay,Walnut City WineWorks

Germany,"Scheurebe, a Riesling hybrid common in Germany and Austria, is a rare find stateside, particularly in dry styles.

France,"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines.

Argentina,"Jammy cassis, blackberry and foxy aromas define the nose on this lush, almost ponderous blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Petit Verdot.

A heavy, grabby finish is bold and voluminous.",Terroir Series Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot,18,California,Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Kaiken
Italy,"This is rather subdued but after ample time in the glass it reveals aromas of oak, toast, espresso and chocolate that continue on to the palate along with vanilla notes. It lacks the vintage's hallmark intensity. Drying tannins give an astringent finish.",Coste di Rose,90,Oregon,Templeton Gap District,Sangiovese,Marchesi di Barolo
Italy,"Pretty aromas include violet, crushed berries and a balsamic note.

US,"Old Wente clones drive the richness of this wine, a mix of lemon, oak and fennel, with a touch of spice on the finish.

Argentina,"There's a mix of herbal aromas and raisin on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. In the mouth, it's edgy and rubbery, with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, tobacco and citrus peel finish raw and rubbery. This will need a lot of air and also hearty  food to show its better side.",Grand Reserve Winemaker's Selection,25,California,Rutherford,Zinfandel,Proemio

France,"This is a firmly wood-aged wine, full of spice and burnt toast flavors. They leave little room for the berry fruits at the moment. It is structured, a statement wine with its heavy bottle, and needing time to round out. Drink from 2016.",Marie de Beauregard,,Washington,Margaret River,Cabernet Sauvignon,Saget la Perrière
US,"This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit. Textured in soft undertones of silk, it also offers plenty of fresh herb, a component to take advantage of in pairing.",Brown Ranch,72,British Columbia,Riverina,Cabernet Sauvignon,Saintsbury

Portugal,"This is a rich and jammy wine, packed with black fruits as well as dark tannins. Dark chocolate flavors come from the wood aging which also leaves a burnt taste. These both suggest this potentially fine wine needs to age. Drink from 2016.",Veedha,12,Goriska Brda,Central Coast,Gewürztraminer,Sogevinus
US,"Even with some hours of breathing time, this remains tight and tannic, with compact flavors of black cherry hard candy. A streak of cola is highlighted with brown spices. The wine loses momentum in the finish, which thins out and quickly fades.",La Colina Vineyard,60,Península de Setúbal,Sta. Rita Hills,Rosé,Torii Mor

France,"This super-rich wine is dominated by ripe Merlot that is given structure by leaner Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is ripe, full of black plum flavors and dark tannins.

France,"The softest hint of apricot can be discerned on the nose. The palate reinforces this flavor with more soft stone fruit and just a touch of off-dry sweetness. The result is a very expressive, gently but deeply fruited, slender palate that will sing with spicy Asian dishes or soft cheeses. It offers wonderfully lasting flavor.",Vieilles Vignes,22,Alenquer,Green Valley,Pinot Blanc,Paul Blanck

Spain,"Aromas of raw oak, cinnamon, bacon and clove outmuscle fruit on this rough, tannic, scraping 2013. Flavors of toast, chocolate and baking spices push blackberry and black-plum fruit towards an oaky, abrasive finish with rocky tannins and accents of chocolate and cinnamon. Holding this for another couple of years may or may not soften this fierce but tasty RDD.",Crianza,40,California,Anjou,Chenin Blanc,Arzuaga

Spain,"This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time.

It finishes long with a lingering kiss of sweetness.",Kabinett,25,Oregon,Santa Cruz County,Pinot Noir,Schloss Vollrads
Australia,"From vines that were 79 years old when the fruit was harvested, this is made in a deliberately lean style to encourage cellaring.

US,"Emblematic of the emerging trend of pushing finished alcohol levels down and aromatics up, this puts the flavor emphasis on subtle complexity.

Australia,"Full-bodied and plush yet vibrant and imbued with fresh fruit, this is simply superb. The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes.

Spain,"Jammy, candied aromas suggest cherry Kool-Aid. This Carignan-Grenache-Syrah blend is narrow and juicy in feel, with raw red-fruit flavors that are also candied and suggestive of animal. This is decent but raw on the finish and overall does not deliver much pleasure.",,24,California,Columbia Valley (OR),Zinfandel,Besllum

The flavors are delicate, ranging from cherry to cedar to Italian herbs, with some noticeable complexity.",,20,California,Montilla-Moriles,Pedro Ximénez,Edna Valley Vineyard
France,"This wine is heavily spiced from its wood aging. Fresher fruit flavors do come through to give black currants, bright acidity as well as firmer fruit structure. The wine still needs time, so drink from 2016.",,25,Oregon,Savennières-Roche-Aux-Moines,Chenin Blanc,Etienne de Tauriac
US,"An amalgam of 85% Tannat, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this sports leather and blackberry aromas. The medium-bodied palate comes with tight, finely plaited tannins, and the boosted acids give the wine spine.",,45,California,Ventoux,Rhône-style Red Blend,Fabbioli Cellars

US,"This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.",,21,Limarí Valley,North Fork of Long Island,Gewürztraminer,Happy Canyon Vineyard

US,"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors.

France,"The wine is a velvet glove in an iron fist.

France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert. Drink now through 2035.",Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru,66,Northeastern Italy,Rosso del Veronese,Red Blend,Domaine Marcel Deiss
France,"A hint of caramelized apple clings to the nose, as well as a certain creaminess. The palate reveals a core of stone, chalk and lanolin, all framed with the purest notion of lemon zest. This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going. The freshness is incisive, the complexity and length immense. This is simply beautiful and leaves you totally refreshed.

France,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.",Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru,50,California,New Mexico,Viognier,Biecher & Schaal
US,"This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage.

US,"It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases.

It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.",Sierra Madre,50,Victoria,Coteaux du Languedoc,Rhône-style Red Blend,Arcadian
France,"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment.

This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026.",,60,South Australia,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Gris,Château Malartic-Lagravière
France,"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep.

The wine is dense with the potential for aging over a considerable time. Drink from 2025.,,250,Southwest France,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Petite Verdot,Château Trotanoy
France,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",Engelberg Grand Cru,45,California,Carignano del Sulcis,Carignano,Domaine Pfister

France,"The heady scent of Damask rose hints unmistakably to Gewürztraminer. The palate follows lusciously, generously and luxuriantly: wonderfully sweet notions of peach, ripe apricot and yellow mirabelle plum are perfumed with a rose petal scent but are also pervaded by a gentle citrus freshness that lifts everything. The length is astonishing and dreamy. This is dangerously delicious.",Grand Cru Pfersigberg Doux,90,California,Howell Mountain,Syrah,Domaine Barmès-Buecher
France,"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean.

Italy,"Truffle, leather, forest floor, pipe tobacco and purple flower aromas all come together in this young, balanced Brunello.

Australia,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond.",Bin 707,500,Stellenbosch,South Eastern Australia,Pinot Grigio,Penfolds
US,"A perennial standout, this Syrah is cofermented with 10% Viognier, all fruit sourced from a site on the western edge of Sonoma Mountain in the cool confines of the Petaluma Gap.

France,"The full tilt of ripe peach hits the nose at once, followed by glimpses of marmalade and peach compote. The palate follows with the same aromatic intensity, enriching the peach compote notes even further with lemony barley sugar and fresh caramel, pierced by tangy citrus acidity. The flavors are mature and precise, opulent but tempered, and have a decadent touch. This is lovely now but has the concentration and drive to evolve.

Spain,"Certain wines exude a sense of elevated excellence. This one gets to that level via aromas of spice cake, baked plum and tobacco aromas.

France,"There is something very pure and lifted about this: right now it is so taut that it just says citrus and stone. There is something both ripe and tart, a very lemon-like freshness, with generosity and fruit. There is unusual concentration and for now, while the aromas are still tightly wound, the absolutely stony serious texture is on full display. The purity of this is astonishing and has something authentic and enticing about it. Give this time. Drink 2020–2040.",Kastelberg Grand Cru,30,New York,Washington,Sémillon,Biecher & Schaal

France,"This is a perfumed ripe wine, packed with generous tannins that still give a style and elegance that is a remove from the older overripe style of Pavie.

Australia,"From vines planted in 1912, this has been an icon of South Australia Shiaz since 1952, when it was first bottled as a single-vineyard wine.

Australia,"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated.

France,"A lovely heady note of citrus peel and moss hovers above the crisp apple notes of the nose. The bone-dry palate is taut, streaked with absolute lemon freshness and very, very pure. This is linear and totally toned, majoring in the tart and invigorating end of the citrus spectrum. All the more excitement for us. Notions of wet stone pop up and remain on the palate. This is refreshing now but will absolutely reward patience.

France,"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.",Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,98,California,Lodi,Port,Domaine Marcel Deiss
France,"There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last.

Powerful and elegant, it does the variety justice.",Miljenko's Selection Estate Grown,65,Coastal Region,Friuli Isonzo,Sauvignon,Grgich Hills
New Zealand,"This is a bit fuller and more textural than many Marlborough Sauvignons, which gives it an extra dimension. The aromas show just enough grassy punch to make them pop, while smooth grapefruit flavors build in intensity on the long finish.",,20,Swartland,Rutherglen,Muscadelle,Spy Valley
Argentina,"Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.",Terroir Series Edición Limitada Finca las Piedras,45,Oregon,Asolo Prosecco Superiore,Glera,Trapiche
Spain,"Lime and mineral aromas drive the nose on this fairly full-bodied brut nature from a warm vintage. On the palate, this is balanced, with bubbles absorbed into the wine's fabric. Up-front salty notes are backed by briny apple, nectarine and yeasty flavors, while this is sophisticated and fairly complex on the finish.",Privat Opus Evolutium Gran Reserva Brut Nature,46,Central Italy,Venezie,Pinot Grigio,Alta Alella
France,Organically grown grapes from one of the top Provence estates have produced this light grey-pink colored wine. It is a delicious fruity confection of bright red berries and tangy acidity. There is an attractive touch of minerality to give the wine structure. Drink now.,Le Pas du Moine,24,California,Trentino,Red Blend,Château Gassier
France,"This is a ripe beautifully balanced wine. It has the extra richness and density that comes from a vine produced in the close to Monte Sainte-Victoire. Full of raspberry and orange fruits, the wine has a final tangy herbal edge. Drink now.",Terre Promise,20,Other,Russian River Valley,Marsanne-Roussanne,Château Henri Bonnaud
US,"This wine wears its high alcohol well, appearing light in the glass and delivering loads of chaparral spice, sandalwood, beet, rhubarb and earthy dust scents on the nose. Although light in body, the palate boasts an underlying juiciness, packed with cranberry, thyme and pencil shaving flavors.",Sharen's Vineyard,48,Victoria,North Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Cottonwood Canyon
US,"Though light in color and body, this wine carries tremendous aromas and flavors, thanks in part to its 5% cofermented Viognier. The nose shows charred beef, crushed elderberry and potpourri scents, while the palate shows tart red currant and cranberry fruit, with smoked beef, white, pepper, rosemary and fennel accents.",North Slope,43,Victoria,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,Pinot Noir,Demetria
US,"Unconventional but outstanding, this wine is an earthy throwback to an earlier era, from its light, brownish color to its dried leaf, rhubarb and wet earth aromas to its lean but complex red cherry, rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Wild yeast and wild bacteria were used for the primary and malolactic fermentations, respectively.",Clone 05 Charles Vineyard,52,Victoria,Finger Lakes,Meritage,Foursight
US,"This wine is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The aromas are almost completely shut down at present, with just hints of barrel spice, herb and dark fruit. The fruit flavors are similarly locked up, backed by lightly grainy tannins. There are good things going on but it needs time to reveal itself. Best after 2022.",Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Vineyards,60,Tejo,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Pepper Bridge
US,"The winery produces two outstanding Pinots from estate vineyards planted in 1972. This is big and chewy (as the potent alcohol might suggest) and aging in 50% new French oak puts flavors of toasted coconut and caramel around smooth supple cherry fruit. There's a finishing hint of eucalyptus; all in all, it's a terrific value and a truly original take on Pinot Noir.",Elkton Vineyard,28,Requinoa,Sannio,Piedirosso,River's Edge
Austria,"Ripe yellow plum pervades the nose of this wine. The palate brings more Grüner Veltliner savoriness, with hints of yeast and herb. Light in body and dry in mouthfeel, it refreshes with a lovely herbal citrus tang on the finish.",Wieden,23,California,Ancient Lakes,Viognier,Salomon-Undhof
US,Aromas suggest green apple and melon. This wine drinks dry with a lightly spritzy feel but the flavor concentration seems lacking.,The Reserve,22,Southern Italy,Seneca Lake,Sparkling Blend,14 Hands
US,"This is packed with herbal character, from the aroma through the flavors and the finish. It smells like fresh-cut grass, tastes like snap peas and scallions, and has a bright, almost sharp, citrusy tartness.",Fox Hill Vineyard,25,Loncomilla Valley,Costa Toscana,Cabernet Franc,Vía
Spain,"Yeasty, bready aromas lack the citric kick and minerality that top Rueda whites deliver in spades. The palate is dilute but slightly creamy, while yeasty flavors are low on fruit and finish with a note of gardenia flower.",Quintaluna,20,Tejo,Mendoza,Sémillon,Ossian
Spain,"This opens with scratchy, slightly dirty aromas of blueberry and blackberry. The palate is heavy and jammy, but also somewhat raw and abrasive. Cherry and plum flavors are basic, while an inoffensive finish falls off quickly.",Latria,18,Portuguese Table Wine,Emilia,Lambrusco,Malondro
Argentina,"Initially this smells earthy and rubbery, but with airing it shows roasted dark-berry aromas mixed with horsey leather. The palate is full, tannic and scratchy, with black-fruit flavors, pepper, toast and herbal notes. Toast and coffee flavors are found on a hard, tannic finish. Tasted twice with mixed results.",Reserve,15,France Other,Toscana,Rosato,Caligiore
Spain,"Chunky, raisiny aromas are heavy. In the mouth, this is big, high on acid and a bit shaky in terms of overall balance. Medicinal cherry and plum flavors finish raisiny and plump, with a shot of tomato thrown in.",Reserva,16,France Other,Emilia,Sparkling Blend,Conde de Jauregui
Italy,"Concentrated but one-dimensional, this features aromas of stewed fruit, fig, almond, nail polish and coconut, all of which follow through to the warm, monolithic palate. It's already extremely evolved, and lacks vibrancy and complexity.",,120,Southern Italy,Mendoza,Malbec-Syrah,Casa Raia
US,"The reductive scent of rubber meets with deep blackberry on the nose. The palate proves more interesting, with mocha and espresso notes laid over blackberry fruit, all framed in strong tannins.",Family Reserve,35,Languedoc-Roussillon,Oltrepò Pavese,Pinot Nero,Joullian
US,"This wine from a vineyard 25 miles east of the Monterey Bay shows a slightly reductive character on the nose, with burnt rubber alongside cherry and mint. The palate shows cranberry and pomegranate fruits, with lots of leathery tannins.",Estate,20,South Australia,Valpolicella Ripasso Classico,Red Blend,Pietra Santa

US,"Juicy red cherry and raspberry flavors are layered with toast, cinnamon, vanilla and spice in this ornate yet approachable wine. It's sunny and plush on the midpalate, but grippy tannins mark a tight, brisk finish.",,22,California,Knights Valley,Merlot,Serenity
US,"There's a ruddy ripeness to red raspberry and cherry flavors in this delicately framed Merlot. It's crisp with acidity and enticingly spiced, but finishes abruptly.",,28,Central Italy,Wahluke Slope,Chardonnay,Serenity
US,"This offering conveys blueberry, herbs, olive and tire rubber. The flavors are lighter in style, with just a hint of sweetness, trailing toward the finish. This would make an excellent and crowd-pleasing by-the-glass selection.",,15,Central Italy,Sonoma County-Napa County,Chardonnay,Sharecropper's
US,"Aromatically expressive, this conveys cranberry and milk chocolate. It's full of fruit and barrel flavors with a lightly creamy feel.",,8,Southern Italy,Valpolicella Superiore,Red Blend,Snoqualmie

Spain,"Dusty, scratchy, spicy red-fruit aromas register as feral. This is wiry and medicinal in feel, with spicy black-plum flavors that are brash and oaky. Peppery spice dominates an otherwise hollow finish.",Macho Man,17,California,Chianti Colli Pisani,Sangiovese,Casa Rojo
US,"Half fermented in oak with the rest in stainless steel, this wine offers lees, butter and vanilla, with a dry, medium-bodied feel.",,16,California,Vin de Pays du Comté Tolosan,Rosé,Vale
US,"This unusual blend made from Verdelho, Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc grapes is dry, reasonably fruity and smooth in texture. It starts with canteloupe aromas, goes to golden apple flavors and leaves an earthy touch of walnut on the finish.",Verdigris,30,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pouilly-Loché,Chardonnay,Las Positas
France,"This is a dark and probably too-tannic wine. A very dry, extracted character gives bitterness more than fruit. It's still young and has the Saint-Estèphe tannins in abundance, although its future with this dryness is uncertain.",,30,Oregon,Ancient Lakes,Albariño,Château Tour des Termes
Argentina,"Mint and graphite aromas make for a cool nose on this 50/50 Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon. Rubbery tannins mixed with extracted berry flavors create more noise than poise on the palate. A spicy, herbal, chocolaty finish is punchy and borderline punishing.",Special Blend Reserva,22,Washington,Sonoma County-Napa County,Sparkling Blend,Cinco Sentidos
US,"Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish.",Estate Grace Benoist Ranch,43,Oregon,Italy,Moscato,Etude
France,"Packed with fruit, this is a fine, simple Bordeaux. Red fruits leap out of the glass, allied to light tannins. They make for a wine that's ready to drink young and fresh.",,15,Languedoc-Roussillon,Prosecco Treviso,Glera,Grand Bateau
US,"Varietal notes of potting soil, flowers and dark cherry partner with licorice and pickling spices. The fruit flavors seem sweet, almost as if carrying some residual sugar, with some mesquite flavors that distract.",,45,Languedoc-Roussillon,Yakima Valley,White Blend,Stina's
US,"While lemony-fresh with a streak of crushed-stone minerality, this medium-bodied white lacks the exuberance and spice expected of Gewürztraminer. It's refreshing and pleasing nonetheless, with a spray of lingering white blossom perfume on the finish.",Doyle Vineyard,22,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Meunier,Swedish Hill
US,"This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.",Sonas,25,California,Mokelumne River,Merlot,OS Winery
France,"Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough.",Château la Rose Bourdieu,12,Southern Italy,Napa County-Sonoma County,Pinot Noir,Producta Vignobles

US,"This is solidly varietal, with a sleek mix of pear flesh and skin. Some tension created between the phenolic bite and tart acidity carries through into the finish. It suggests that a proper match, with a relatively oily fish perhaps, will bring out its best.",Signature Collection,18,Southern Italy,California,Refosco,King Estate
France,"Dominated by the local Duras grape, this spicy and fruity wine has an intriguing blend of juicy acidity and leathery tannins. It gives a wine that could benefit from aging while also being ready to drink now. Give it the benefit of the doubt and wait until 2016.",Les Gourmands,16,Oregon,Montello e Colli Asolani,Red Blend,L'Enclos des Braves
Spain,"Apple and pear aromas provide a smooth entry to a round, slightly creamy palate. Grapefruit, green-herb, pear and apple flavors lean toward sweet and ripe, while the finish holds onto just enough acidic zest.",,12,Southern Italy,Lodi,Moscato,Los Navales de Martúe
US,"Very deep black plum, smashed red berries, concentrated cola and coffee liqueur aromas entice the nose on this blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 40% Zinfandel and 20% Grenache. It's very spicy and lively on the palate with an almost biting, explosive acidity. Flavors of espresso and deep red fruits are noticeable.",Aeolus Estate,50,California,Venezie,Cabernet,Gershon Bachus
US,"This has a rather deep red color and a slightly smoky rim. It offers profuse aromas of black cherry and blackberry, medium to full body and a generous texture.

The finish is lingering and almost sweet.",Estate Bottled,30,California,Wahluke Slope,Rhône-style Red Blend,Greenwood Ridge
US,"You'll taste the 40% new French oak right away, followed by crisp, botanical flavors of lime rind and green apple. It's not a fleshy Chardonnay, instead it's the mineral and botanical flavors that stand out.",Vineyard Select,18,Victoria,Horse Heaven Hills,Pinot Grigio,Gresser

Drink through 2016.",D'Vino,17,South Australia,Monticello,Johannisberg Riesling,Diadema
France,"From the tiny vineyard area of Marcillac in the French mountains on the eastern edge of the southwest region, this tight, fruity wine is a breath of fresh air. It is packed with berry fruits as well as tannins showing that it will age. Red fruits burst out at the end.

Italy,"Subdued aromas of black currant, chocolate and a whiff cedar lead the nose of this blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot.

US,"There's quite a bit of green on this nose of this blend of 63% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvingnon, 2% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, with grilled jalapeño most prevalent.

US,"A vivid gold color and spice-rack aromas like nutmeg and cardamom add a different twist to this medium-bodied and rather rich-textured wine. Those are probably characteristics from aging with oak, and they enhance the clean, fresh fruit flavors in a good way.",Winemaker's,11,Oregon,Hudson River Region,Cabernet Franc,Table No. 7

While the tannins are still aggressive, the fruit richness is starting to dry out.",Fuochi,40,British Columbia,Santa Ynez Valley,Lagrein,Poggioventoso
Italy,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this fresh wine opens with aromas of black cherry and freshly ground pepper that carry over to the palate along with notes of black raspberry and a hint of orange rind.

France,"The richest and most generous hints of dried pear and fruit loaf rise from the glass. The palate continues in the same, generous vein with plenty of pear, shimmering and scintillating with juicy, mellow and just off-dry ripeness.

Italy,"Cedar, black currants, prune and tobacco aromas unfold in the glass. The warm, forward palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, black pepper and tobacco alongside astringent tannins.

US,"This 100% varietal wine comes from Coyote Canyon in the Horse Heaven Hills.

It brings some appeal but the variety gets lost.",,28,Northeastern Italy,Vista Flores,Pinot Noir,Trinity Vineyards

US,"It's odd to find reductive elements on a white wine, but this—which comes from a property that's grown grapevines for a century or so—shows an tarry funk on the nose, with crisp pears and honeyed apples slowly emerging. The palate offers stonefruit syrup, honey and poached pears, and also gives off rubbery reductive elements.",,,Mendoza Province,Emilia-Romagna,Moscato,Solis

Austria,"The nose of this wine is somewhat reduced, signalling that it needs to breathe.

Cedar and black currant aromas meet black cherry and blackberry flavors, while a layer of fine-grained tannins frames the whole picture.",,25,Washington,Puglia,Montepulciano,Moniker
Spain,"Creamy oak aromas shout “vanilla” and “wood resin” in full voice. This is a rough wine with stampeding tannins.

France,"There is not just a notion of ripeness but almost of overripeness of pear fruit on the nose, accompanied by hints of honeysuckle. There also are hints of sandalwood and gentle vanilla. The palate is cushioned with mellow residual sweetness, making the rich flavors even more rich and generous.

Consistent from vintage to vintage is the elegance and depth of detail, beginning with subtle, entwined fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry.

France,"This is a spicy wine, soft and open. Its tannins and red berry fruits have a diffuse character that takes away the focus of the wine. It will age quickly.",Les Moulins du Haut-Lansac,21,Piedmont,Terra Alta,Carignane,Château Haut-Lansac
US,"Aromas of black plums, medicinal sour cherries and toasted nuts seem sweet and oxidative—like a fortified wine. With that in mind, this is a table wine, and it tastes unexpectedly dry.

Argentina,"Berry aromas come in front of a sharp, plummy palate. This tastes herbal, spicy and woody, with dry berry flavors that turn tangy, edgy and oaky on the finish.",Made with Organic Grapes,11,Northeastern Italy,McLaren Vale,Semillon-Chardonnay,Santa Julia
France,"A hard, too-toasty wine that is completely dominated by smoky wood flavors. Whatever fruit is there is swamped, only a juicy hint through the wine's weight.",,35,East Coast,Adelaide Hills,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Château Cossieu-Coutelin
